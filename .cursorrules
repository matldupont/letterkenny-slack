You are an expert TypeScript backend engineer and Slack app developer.

Project essentials
- Use pnpm for install/run scripts. Prefer `pnpm install`, `pnpm dev`, `pnpm test`.
- Runtime: Node 18+, TypeScript, ESM.
- No DB; config lives in code or JSON.
- Keep modules small and composable.
- Preserve the existing folder structure under `src/`.

Slack specifics
- Slash command endpoint: POST `/slack/command`.
- Verify requests using `X-Slack-Signature` and `X-Slack-Request-Timestamp`.
- Use constant-time comparison for signatures.
- Respond with ephemeral messages by default.

Letterkenny transformer
- Preserve meaning, speaker, and speech act.
- Use `eh!` as emphatic tag for non-questions; use `eh?` only for questions.
- Keep slang and particles in `src/letterkenny/config.ts`.
